## Everything you need to know about EIP712 on zkSync Era

The Ethereum Improvement Proposal [EIP-712: Typed structured data hashing and signing](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) introduces hashing and signing of typed-structured data as well as bytestrings.

In the following sections we'll explain how to build, sign, encode and send a well-formed EIP712 transaction request to the network.

The steps:

1. Create a base request and fill it with sufficient data for estimating the fee.
2. Estimate the fee and add it the request.
3. Derive the EIP712 signable transaction from the request and sign it and add the signature to the request.
5. RLP-encode the request and concatenate the transaction type at the beginning.
6. Send the transaction using the `sendRawTransaction` method.

### Building an EIP712 transaction request

These transactions have the same fields as standard Ethereum transactions, but they also have fields that contain additional L2-specific data that should be set in the `customData` field.

In the case of zkSync Era, this fields are the following:

- `gasPerPubdata`: A field denoting the maximum amount of gas the user is willing to pay for a single byte of pubdata.
- `customSignature`: A field with a custom signature for the cases in which the signer's account is not an EOA.
- `paymasterParams`: A field with parameters for configuring the custom paymaster for the transaction. Parameters include the address of the paymaster and the encoded input (you could find a tutorial on building a custom paymaster in the [zkSync Era docs](https://era.zksync.io/docs/dev/tutorials/custom-paymaster-tutorial.html)).
- `factory_deps`: A non-empty array of bytes. For deployment transactions, it should contain the bytecode of the contract being deployed. If the contract is a factory contract, i.e. it can deploy other contracts, the array should also contain the bytecodes of the contracts which it can deploy.

This is how a noop `customData` object looks like:

```json
"customData": {
  "gasPerPubdata": "0xc350",
  "factoryDeps": [],
  "customSignature": "0x",
  "paymasterParams": {
    "paymaster": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "paymasterInput": "0x"
  }
}
```

We call the representation of this structure `Eip712Meta` and its definition and implementation is located in the [`src/eip712/meta.rs`](/src/eip712/meta.rs) module.

The transaction request is built in three stages being the final the one being encoded and sent to the network. 

In the first stage you fill the request with *input data* (i.e. this could be `from`, `to`, `nonce`, `gasPrice`, `value`, `chainId`, `type` in the case of a transfer transaction). In the second stage the request is filled with fee data obtained from the network given the first stage's result (i.e. `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `gasPerPubdata`, `gasLimit`). Finally, the last stage consists on adding the EIP712 signature to the `customSignature` field of the `customData` object.

This is how a noop EIP712 transaction request looks like:

```json
{
  "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "from": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "nonce": "0x0",
  "gasLimit": "0x0",
  "gasPrice": "0x0",
  "data": "0x",
  "value": "0x0",
  "chainId": "0x10e",
  "type": "0x71",
  "accessList": [],
  "maxPriorityFeePerGas": "0x0",
  "maxFeePerGas": "0x0",
  "customData": {
    "gasPerPubdata": "0xc350",
    "factoryDeps": [],
    "customSignature": "0x",
    "paymasterParams": {
      "paymaster": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "paymasterInput": "0x"
    }
  },
  "ccipReadEnabled": false
}
```

### Building an EIP712 signable transaction

Instead of signing the RLP-encoded transaction, the user signs the a typed EIP712 structure which we called `Eip712Transaction`. This structure is built from the transaction request as it contains a subset of its fields. The `Eip712Transaction` structure is defined in the [`src/eip712/transaction.rs`](/src/eip712/transaction.rs) module and a noop one looks like the following:

```json
{
  "txType": "0x71",
  "from": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "gasLimit": "0x0",
  "gasPerPubdataByteLimit": "0xc350",
  "maxFeePerGas": "0x0",
  "maxPriorityFeePerGas": "0x0",
  "paymaster": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "nonce": "0x0",
  "value": "0x0",
  "data": "0x",
  "factoryDeps": [],
  "paymasterInput": "0x"
}
```

### Encoding an EIP712 transaction

### Signing an EIP712 transaction

The signing could be done by `ethers-rs` by the `LocalWallet` with the method `sign_typed_data`. What you are signing here is the keccak hash of the EIP712 transaction encoding. Internally, this is done by the `sighash` method.

### Sending an EIP712 transaction request

What is sent to the network is the concatenation of the transaction type with the RLP-encoding of the transaction request containing the signed message.

## zkSync Era’s JSON-RPC methods

### The `ZKSProvider` trait

zkSync Era fully supports the standard [Ethereum JSON-RPC API](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) and adds some L2-specific features.

> As long as code does not involve deploying new smart contracts, which can only be deployed using [EIP712 transactions](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/api.html#eip712), *no changes to the codebase are needed*.

zkSync Era The `ZKSProvider` trait defines the methods that can be used to interact with [zkSync Era's JSON-RPC API](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/api.html#zksync-era-json-rpc-methods) (the previously L2-specific features mentioned above).

## CLI
### Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:lambdaclass/zksync-web3-rs.git
cd zksync-web3-rs
make cli
```

### Usage

Running `zksync-web3-cli` outputs the following:

```
Usage: zksync-web3-cli [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  deploy
  call
  get-contract
  get-transaction
  help             Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --host <HOST>  [default: 65.108.204.116]
  -p, --port <PORT>  [default: 8545]
  -h, --help         Print help
  -V, --version      Print version
```

#### `zksync-web3-cli deploy`

Deploys the contract located in `CONTRACT_PATH/src` signing the transaction with `PRIVATE_KEY`.

```
zksync-web3-cli deploy --contract <CONTRACT_PATH> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

#### `zksync-web3-cli call`

Calls `FUNCTION_SIGNATURE` of `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with args `FUNCTION_ARGS`. If you want o call a `public view` contract function then you don't need to provide your `PRIVATE_KEY`. You must provide the latter only if you want to call a contract function that performs a state change.

```
zksync-web3-cli call --contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --function <FUNCTION_SIGNATURE> --args <FUNCTION_ARGS> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

#### `zksync-web3-cli get-contract`

Gets `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`'s bytecode.

```
zksync-web3-cli get-contract --contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

#### `zksync-web3-cli get-transaction`

Get the transaction corresponding to `TRANSACTION_HASH`.

```
zksync-web3-cli get-transaction --transaction <TRANSACTION_HASH>
```

#### `zksync-web3-cli balance`

Gets the balance of the `ACCOUNT_ADDRESS`.

```
zksync-web3-cli balance --account <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
```

#### `zksync-web3-cli pay`

Pays `AMOUNT` from `SENDER_ADDRESS` to `RECEIVER_ADDRESS` signing the transaction with `SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY`.

```
zksync-web3-cli pay --amount <AMOUNT_TO_TRANSFER> --from <SENDER_ADDRESS> --to <RECEIVER_ADDRESS> --private-key <SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

#### `zksync-web3-cli compile`

> This command is a wrapper for the zksolc compiler.

Compiles the contract located in `PATH_TO_CONTRACT` using the zksolc compiler.

```
zksync-web3-cli compile --solc <PATH_TO_SOLC> --standard-json -- <PATH_TO_CONTRACT>
```
